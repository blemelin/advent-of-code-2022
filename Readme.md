# Advent of Code 2022

This is my solutions to the *Advent of Code* of 2022. All solutions are written in [Rust].

## Run a solution

You'll need to put your own input files inside the `inputs` folder (named `dayX.txt`, where `X` is the number of the 
day). Note that you only need the input files for the solutions you intend to run.

When everything's ready, use this command :

```shell
cargo run --bin dayX # Where X is the number of the day.
```
